# App 1 â€“ Dm-Delay

##  Project Overview

**Dm-Delay** is a simple yet practical React app that simulates sending a direct message (DM) with a specified time delay. The user can type a message, set a delay in seconds, and trigger a timed message send. The app also allows cancelling the action before the time expires.

This project is part of my **30 Apps in 30 Days** challenge, aimed at mastering frontend development by building small but meaningful applications.
